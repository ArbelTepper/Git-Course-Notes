# Introduction to Git and GitHub Course Notes

The PDF is a file I made with my takeaways from the amazing [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github/) course by Google on Coursera.

I decided to make this file in order to collect my thoughts, some useful commands and knowledge in a format that best matches my needs.

It is meant to serve as a cheatsheet and as a refresher for me throughout my development journey, and perhaps others will find it useful as well.

The file is comprised of 3 main sections: Useful Commands, best Practices for Collaboration, and Creating a Pull Request, which are packed with tips from the course.
